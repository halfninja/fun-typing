# Typing game

https://halfninja.github.io/fun-typing/

Not really a game - just a big typing area with a bank of emoji for my kids to play on the keyboard.

A design decision was made to not require any modules or a build step, so everything in src is served as-is.

## To do

* More emoji (the more advanced ones tied together with ZWJs seemed to be falling apart)
* Handle fullscreen better?
* Mobile layout
* Font/formatting controls?
